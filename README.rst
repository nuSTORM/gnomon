Development team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Development is done within github.  The development page is here:

https://github.com/nuSTORM/gnomon

Feel free to fork the project then make a pull request once you have developed a feature.  You do not need any special
access to start developing on gnomon.  There are, however, develop team leaders who must approve your request to commit
code.  They will review your code -- or assign somebody to review your code -- before merging the commit with the trunk.

There is currently no mailing list so it is encouraged that you contact the authors directly.

Authors
~~~~~~~

The official list of authors is maintained here:

https://github.com/nuSTORM?tab=members

To keep the list of authors within the code, an unofficial list follows (alphabetical):


.. include:: AUTHORS
