For Genie to work, we have to convert the GDML geometry to ROOT.  However, for
some bizarre reason we are unable to do this using pyroot, compiled ROOT, or
ROOT macros since there's some known segfault.  This is not fixed yet in the
ROOT trunk.  The fix is to run:

root

Then at the prompt:

x = TGeoManager()
x.Import("iron_scint_bars.gdml")
x.Export("iron_scint_bars.root")

In a shell.  Do not add semi-colons!  Do not correct the C++ in any way because
if you use correct C++ it will break.  You must redo this every time you change
 the gdml file.
