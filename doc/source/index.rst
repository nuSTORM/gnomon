Gnomon: NuSTORM Detector Simulation
===================================

This softare is intended for people within the NuSTORM collaboration in order to simulate the response of the detectors used for the oscillation analyses.

Development
-----------

Gnomon is under heavy development.  Tagged releases will happen soon,
but in the meantime we encourage people to obtain the code directly
from the Mercurial repository hosted at Bitbucket:
